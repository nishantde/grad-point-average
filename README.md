# grad-point-average
A simplistic and basic program to calculate the cumulative GPA usually needed for undergraduate and graduate courses.

Currently, the program sits at around 50 lines of code, and as such, does not require any modules to be imported. Running it is quite simple. Enter the following command in the terminal in the directory of the file:

`$> python calculate.py`

You will be required to enter three things:
1. The course name
2. The grade obtained
3. Number of credits the course is worth

The program will then display your cumulative GPA after each entry.
